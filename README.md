# MLFlow Tutorial

## Overview

## Problem statement

Understanding mlflow, it's use cases for teams, individuals, and enterprises, to effectively teach a tutorial for data science use and application. 

## Proposed work

Introduction to the three main tiers of mlflow: tracking, projects, and models.   Explaining the abstract concepts, giving examples, and finally walking through a live tutorial demonstrating the ui as well as api usage. 

## Dependencies 

* Databricks dependencies 
* mlflow builders 

## Stakeholders

- Teams
- Data Scientists 
- Organizations

## Risks

- model sharing 
- models that are being served can be accessed 
- cloud component runs risks ass. with cloud

## Success criteria

- Number of organizations presented to / people 
- Clarity of presentation across different skill levels and experience with data science 

## Blockers 

* unsure of direction of linking with AWS storage buckets as well as databricks
  * essentially unsure of what components I should connect mlflow with, as I am not sure of target group for presentation 
* have only been working with mlflow given example code 

## Next Steps

* connect to aws storage bucket potentially 

* automate running code, although unnecessary 

  * can better show model runs on graph
